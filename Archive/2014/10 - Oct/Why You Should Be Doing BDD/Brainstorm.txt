	When I started TDD
	Origins
  Who? Why? When?

  The problems
  Programmers wanted to know 
	* where to start, 
	* what to test and what not to test, 
	* how much to test in one go, 
	* what to call their tests, 
	* and how to understand why a test fails
  
My Problems
	Did I know

    What to test And What not
    When tests fail
